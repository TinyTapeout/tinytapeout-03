# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "Pseudo Random generator."

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Uses a General Register controled with a State Machine with a Pseudo Random Generator Circuit. 

      Puts a pseudo random data un wave output bus.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, push load o rand buttom. Load change one time data out bus. Rand change continius data out bus.
