# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  description:  "Multiply two 8-bit numbers, get a 16-bit result."

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Do synchronous reset first, then on each rising clock edge...

      Clock in each of two 8-bit values, one `nibble` at a time (high to low).

      Then clock out a 16-bit value, one byte (via `result`) at a time (high to low).

# Instructions on how someone could test your project:
  how_to_test:  |
      After synchronous reset, expect `result` output to be 0.

      Set `nibble` to a value of your choice, then pulse the clock.

      Repeat 3 more times.

      Then pulse the clock 1 more times, each time expecting to get a byte at the output `result`.
