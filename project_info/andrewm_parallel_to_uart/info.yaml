# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  description:  "Loads two half-bytes into registers, then sends over UART"

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      4 bits should be loaded into registers through the `data` pins twice - once for the LSB of a byte, once for the MSB of a byte (specified using the `mode` pins). 
      Once ready, `mode` can be set to transmit to send the loaded byte over UART.
      
# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      When mode[1,2]=01, data is clocked in as the least-significant 4-bits for a UART transmissions. When mode[1,2]=10, the same occurs for the most-significant 4-bits. When mode[1,2]=11, the complete data should get sent over UART.
