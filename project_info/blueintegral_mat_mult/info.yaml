# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  how_it_works: |
      Just performs arithmetic to do the matrix multiplication and outputs the result.


# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Use the DIP switches to set the value of each position in the two matrices you're multiplying. That means that each position in each input matrix can only contain a zero or one. The output is 4 groups of 2 bits, each group representing one of the positions in the output matrix. 

# A description of what the inputs do
  inputs:               
    - 7 is Matrix 1, top left
    - 6 is Matrix 1, top right
    - 5 is Matrix 1, bottom left
    - 4 is Matrix 1, bottom right
    - 3 is Matrix 2, top left
    - 2 is Matrix 2, top right
    - 1 is Matrix 2, bottom left
    - 0 is Matrix 2, bottom right
# A description of what the outputs do
  outputs:
    - 7 is Result matrix, top left, bit 1
    - 6 is Result matrix, top left, bit 0
    - 5 is Result matrix, top right, bit 1
    - 4 is Result matrix, top right, bit 0
    - 3 is Result matrix, bottom left, bit 1
    - 2 is Result matrix, bottom left, bit 0
    - 1 is Result matrix, bottom right, bit 1
    - 0 is Result matrix, bottom right, bit 0
