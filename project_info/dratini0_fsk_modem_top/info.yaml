# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here.
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  how_it_works: |
      On the transmit side, it has two triangle wave synthesizers.
      The frequency of one can be altered by the data in pin, and the other one can be mixed in for DTMF.

      On the receive side, it takes the input, heterodynes it with some square waves, and then filters I and Q over a 31 tap FIR filter.
      Finally, a phase detector is applied, that output is differentiated, and filtered for glitches.
      The noise immunity of this approach is questionable.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      * Set registers over SPI.
      * Connect the "incoming" phone line to a comparator, and to samples_in.
      * Connect the "outgoing" phone line to an R-2R DAC, and to samples_out.
      * Connect a serial port to data_in and data_out.
      * Enjoy squawking 300bps serial!
