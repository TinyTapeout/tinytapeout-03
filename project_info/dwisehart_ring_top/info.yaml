  title:        "Ring oscillator with skew correction"
  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "Fixing the problem of skew in a ring oscillator with a differential clock ring. "

  how_it_works: |
      Multiple buffers connected in series have a problem: they skew the incoming waveform on the output because the
      rise and fall time of the FETs that buffer the signal have uneven rise and fall times.  The solution used here
      is to use a differential clock signal with two rings of buffers running opposite polarity that need to both
      have changed before the output is changed.

      The clock ring is then tested by driving grey counters to see if the resulting output is stable and at an
      expected rate.  The original design--which is still available for testing via cocotb--used multiple rings of
      different lengths to detect skew with differential timings, but that extended design would not fit into
      hardware.

  how_to_test:  |
      After not reset is desasserted, set the bits of select to read one of the grey counters.  The outputs should
      change each half second with something like "7 6 2 ." over two seconds and then repeats.  If a value is not a
      good one, a minus sign is shown instead.  A 762. says the divided ratio is 762:1.  The table belows shows what
      is being measured and what the divide ratio is.  The clock number is the number of stages in its ring buffer.
      In hardware, the only clock that is running is clock 097, which actually has 93 stages.
