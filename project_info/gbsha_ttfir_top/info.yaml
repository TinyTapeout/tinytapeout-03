# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "ttFIR: Digital Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter"
  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "A 4-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter with 6 bit input signal, 6 bit filter coefficients, and 8 bit output signal. **Challenge for future tinytapeouts**: Increase number of taps."

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
    ttFIR implements a digital 4-tap [Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_impulse_response). 
    Inputs, coefficients, and outputs are 6bit, 6bit, and 8bit values, respectively, in [2's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) format. 
    Internally, intermediate products are in 12bit  and the final sum is in 14bit. The 8 most significant bits (MSB) of the final sum are output. The 6 least significant bits (LSB) are discarded, which corresponds to a division by 64.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      - reset high: shift registers for coefficient and output are set to zero.
      - reset low: 
        - 4 clock cycles: 6bit coefficients in 2's complement format are loaded into registers. The coefficients are loaded in reverse order, i.e., coefficient[3], coefficient[2], coefficient[1], coefficient[0] must be provided in clock cycles 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively.
        - input at each clock cycle: 6bit inputs in 2's complement format are loaded into shift register.
        - output at each clock cycle: coefficients and input values in shift register are multiplied, added and output in 8bit 2's complement format.
      - relative to the input, the output is delayed by input register + output register = 2 clock cycles.
      - test inputs and expected outputs are defined in the [cocotb testbench](https://github.com/gbsha/ttfir/blob/main/src/test.py).
