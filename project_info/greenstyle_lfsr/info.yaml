# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Uses 2 cycles each to set the shift and xor mask registers.
      It has 3 operation modes: normal shift, 

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, set the shift register and xor state, after that normal shift mode

# A description of what the inputs do
  inputs:               
    - clock
    - reset
    - mode[0] 00 normal shift mode,  01 set register mode, 
    - mode[1] 10 set mode registers, 11 unused
    - data_in[0] is used for both filling register and xor mask state 
    - data_in[1] needs 2 cycles to fill all 8 bits
    - data_in[2] first cyle is lower 4 bits, 2nd upper 4 bits
    - data_in[3] see above
# A description of what the outputs do
  outputs:
    - output[0] lsb normal lfsr output
    - output[1] other 7 bits to see the full state
    - output[2]
    - output[3]
    - output[4]
    - output[5]
    - output[6]
    - output[7]
