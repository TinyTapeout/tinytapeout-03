# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "Guess 6-bit random number, 3 attemps in one round. "

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Uses '$random' to generate 6-bit random numbers, and input [7:2] to make a guess. 
      
      Some combinatorial logics are used to check if the guessed bit matches the random number bit on positive clock edges. 
      If they match, the corresponding bit in the output [5:0] is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. 
      
      Of course a correct guess will output 6'b111111 and reset random numebr to enter a new round. 
      If the player uses all 3 guesses, the game outputs 6'b000000 and resets with a new random number as well. 

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, output [5:0] should zero out.
