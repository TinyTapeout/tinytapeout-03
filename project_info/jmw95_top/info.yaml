# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  how_it_works: |
      The MSF radio clock bitstream is synchronised, decoded, and the time displayed on an LED display driven by a shift-register.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      * Provide 12.5kHz clock to the clock pin, e.g. using the clock divider set to 0.
      * Connect the data input to a WWVB / MSF receiver module.
      * Connect the inverted input high if the module outputs a 1 when there is no carrier.
      * Connect the shift_date input to a button. If held, the display will show date instead of time.
      * Connect the shift register outputs to a 42-bit shift register chain. Bit 41 is shifted out first.

      Bit | Segment
      ----|--------
      41-35 | Hours tens G-A (41=G, 35=A)
      34-28 | Hours ones G-A as above
      27-21 | Minutes tens G-A as above
      20-14 | Minutes ones G-A as above
      13-7  | Seconds tens G-A as above
      6-0   | Seconds ones G-A as above

      Time and date are always both shifted out, so an 84-bit shift register will show both simultaneously.
