# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  title:        "Super Mario Tune on A Piezo Speaker" # Project title
  language:     "verilog"                             # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
                                                      # Short description of what your project does
  description:  "Plays Super Mario Tune over a Piezo Speaker connected across io_out[1:0]"

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Converts an RTTL ringtone into verilog using Python - and plays it back using differential PWM modulation

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Provide 6.25kHz clock on io_in[0], briefly hit reset io_in[1] (L->H->L) and io_out[1:0] will play a differential sound wave over piezo speaker (Super Mario)
