# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here.

  top_module:  "my_design"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 3.0

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  how_it_works: |
      assign the switches with the first nibble of the first number, make valid high, at the next cycle it will be latched. 
      de-assert valid and assign the switches with the second nibble of the first number, make valid high, at the next cycle it will be latched.
      assign the switches with the first nibble of the second number, make valid high, at the next cycle it will be latched. 
      de-assert valid and assign the switches with the second nibble of the second number, make valid high, at the next cycle it will be latched.
      the result will be 16-bits however we have only 8-b output so, if the toggle bit is high the first 8-b of the result will be shown at the output.
      if the toggle bit is low the second 8-b of the result will be shown at the output.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
