# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  title:        "bad apple"
  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "Plays bad apple over a Piezo Speaker connected across io_out[1:0]. Based on https://github.com/meriac/tt02-play-tune"

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: "Converts an RTTL ringtone into verilog and plays it back using differential PWM modulation."

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:   "Provide 12kHz clock on io_in[0], briefly hit reset io_in[1] (L->H->L) and io_out[1:0] will play a differential sound wave over piezo speaker (Bad Apple)"
