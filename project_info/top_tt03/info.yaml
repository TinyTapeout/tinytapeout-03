# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  description:  "Ring oscillator whose frecuency depends on temperature."

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Uses counters to determine the number of cycles of the ring oscillator within a clock period, wich will then be sent through the UART to determine the temperature vs frecuency caracteristic.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset and enable are set, the ring oscillator should start and then when a START code is received by UART, a value is sent back.
