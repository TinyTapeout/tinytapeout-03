# TinyTapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:    339501025136214612        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 3.0

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Matt Venn"      # Your name
  title:        "Straight through test"      # Project title
  language:     "Wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "Just connects inputs to outputs"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      8 wires connect the 8 inputs to the 8 outputs

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Set any DIP switch high and the corresponding LED should light on the 7 segment display
