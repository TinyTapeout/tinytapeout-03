# TinyTapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:    354091612057990145        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately
#  source_files:        
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 3.0

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Carin Schreiner"      # Your name
  title:        "4bit Adder"      # Project title
  language:     "Wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "This tiny tape out project takes two four bit numberbs and adds them."      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      The halfadder uses simple logic gates. 

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Input bits 0-3 are used for the first number and bits 4-7 for the second number. The output bits 0-3 are the resulting number an bit 4 the carry. All numbers should be in little endian format.
