# TinyTapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:    357106633951414273        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately
#  source_files:        
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 3.0

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Yannick Rei√ü"      # Your name
  title:        "KS-Signal"      # Project title
  language:     "Wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "Set KS-Signal based on track information."      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Simply switches lamps on and off on toggle.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Connect the clock, and the buttons as inputs. Connect the LEDs as outputs in the ordern shown below.

# A description of what the inputs do
  inputs:             
    - track1_free
    - track2_free
    - pre_signal
    - none
    - none
    - allow shunting
    - Vorsicht!
    - shorter breaking distance
# A description of what the outputs do
  outputs:
    - Fahrt! (Green)
    - Halt Erwarten! (Orange)
    - Halt! (Red)
    - Vorsicht! (All yellow)
    - pre signal indicator (white)
    - lower shunting indicator (white)
    - shorter breaking distance (white)
    - none
