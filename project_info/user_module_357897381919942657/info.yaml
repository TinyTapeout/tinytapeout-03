# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  how_it_works: |
      On write enable, the four data-inputs are saved to the d-flipflops selected by the address inputs. The output is always read from the current selected flipflops.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Connect a clock, buttons for reset and write_enable and switches for address and data like shown below. The output can be read by using 4 LEDs or any other kind of binary output device.
