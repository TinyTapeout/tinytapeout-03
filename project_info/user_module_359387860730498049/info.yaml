# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      The ideas was to build a simple BinaryDoorLock with 8-Bits as input. With 8 Bits there are 256 possible combinations
      which can be switched on with the input switches. Only one combination opens the BinaryDoorLock by setting the output pin high.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
