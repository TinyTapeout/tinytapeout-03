# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  how_it_works: |
      Converts a 4 digit binary number to decimal or to hexadecimal using a 7-segment display

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed 
  how_to_test:  |
      Select binary to decimal with input 6 (named Dec, the dot is displayed) or binary to hexadecimal with input 7 (named Hex).
      Input a 4 digit binary number using inputs B3, B2, B1, B0 and see in the 7-segment display the converted number in decimal or hexadecimal.
      All forbiden combinations are not displayed.
