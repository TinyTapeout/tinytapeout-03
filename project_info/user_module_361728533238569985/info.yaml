#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username


# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Test Inverter Project"         # Project title
  language:     "wokwi"                         # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "Inverts every line. This project is also used to fill any empty design spaces."      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Uses 8 inverters to invert every line.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Setting the input switch to on should turn the corresponding LED off.
