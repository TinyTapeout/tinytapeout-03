# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works : | 
   See The [Wokwi gate and simulation](https://wokwi.com/projects/362336485347742721).
   * The sequence in which the counter works is as follows :
   7: 0111
   3: 0011
   5: 0101
   1: 0001
   6: 0110
   2: 0010
   4: 0100
   0: 0000
   Here's how the counter works : first, all the three flip flops are set to 1 then for changing the inputs i have used the switch 1 of the Dip switch.
    * When the count signal is triggered, the first flip-flop (least significant bit) toggles from 1 to 0, which produces the binary number 0111 (decimal 7).
    * The second count signal should not trigger a change in the counter value, as the next count is 3, not 6.
    * The third count signal triggers a change in the counter value, where the second flip-flop toggles from 1 to 0, which produces the binary number 0101 (decimal 5).
    * The fourth count signal should not trigger a change in the counter value, as the next count is 1, not 4.
    * The fifth count signal triggers a change in the counter value, where the first flip-flop toggles from 0 to 1, and the third flip-flop toggles from 0 to 1, which produces the binary number 0110 (decimal 6).
    * The sixth count signal should not trigger a change in the counter value, as the next count is 2, not 5.
    * The seventh count signal triggers a change in the counter value, where the second flip-flop toggles from 0 to 1, which produces the binary number 0100 (decimal 4).
    * The eighth count signal triggers a change in the counter value, where all three flip-flops toggle from 0 to 1, which produces the binary number 0000 (decimal 0).
    * The counter stays at 000 until the count signal is triggered again, which causes all three flip-flops to be set back to 1, and the counting process starts again from the beginning of the sequence.
   In summary, the 3-bit asynchronous down counter counts down in the sequence 7, 3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 4, 0 using three flip-flops and asynchronous inputs to trigger each flip-flop in the sequence.
   
   
# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
   For Testing this project, the user has to use the switch 1 of the dip switch to give different inputs and then get the desired output on the 7-segment display.
