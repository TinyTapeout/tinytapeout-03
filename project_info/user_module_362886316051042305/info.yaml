# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  description:  "3-bit 4-position register using Multiplexers"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Decodes addresses and stores the bits using multiplexers.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed

      To write set the 3 data bits (WriteData0-WriteData2), address of the register to be written to (WriteAddress0/WriteAddress1) and toggle WriteEnable to write the 3-bits to the register at address. To read data set the address of the register to read (ReadAddress0/ReadAddress1) and the data is output on Data0-Data2. The internal state for Data2 at all addresses and an inverted WriteEnable is also output.
