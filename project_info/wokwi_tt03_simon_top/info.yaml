# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      Simon says is a simple electronic memory game: the user has to repeat a growing sequence of colors. 
      The sequence is displayed by lighting up the LEDs. Each color also has a corresponding tone.
      
      In each turn, the game will play the sequence, and then wait for the user to repeat the sequence
      by pressing the buttons according to the color sequence. 
      If the user repeated the sequence correctly, the game will play a "leveling-up" sound, 
      add a new color at the end of the sequence, and move to the next turn.
      
      The game continues until the user has made a mistake. Then a game over sound is played, and the game restarts.

      The game supports four clock speeds, which can be selected using the clk3 and clk1 inputs:

      | clk3 | clk1 | Clock Speed |
      |------|------|-------------|
      | 0    | 0    | 4KHz        |
      | 0    | 1    | 6KHz        |
      | 1    | 0    | 12KHz       |
      | 1    | 1    | 14KHz       |

      Setting the clock speed affects the speed of the game and the tone generator.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      You need four buttons, four LEDs, resistors, and optionally a speaker/buzzer.
      Ideally, you want to use 4 different colors for the buttons/LEDs (red, green,
      blue, yellow).
      1. Connect the buttons to pins `btn1`, `btn2`, `btn3`, and `btn4`, and also 
        connect each button to a pull down resistor.
      2. Connect the LEDs to pins `led1`, `led2`, `led3`, and `led4`, matching 
        the colors of the buttons (so `led1` and `btn1` have the same color, etc.)
      3. Connect the speaker to the `speaker` pin.
      4. Select the clock frequency (using the `clk3` and `clk1` inputs).
      5. Reset the game, and then press any button to start it. Enjoy!
